# Why Kubernetes?

* Evaluation criteria?
* What are the respective levels of effort for developer and operator?
* What is total cost of ownership, operations model?
* What are large enterprises struggling with?
* What opinions and practices are evolving in industry?
* In a crowded field, what integrated feature-set makes an implementation pop to top?

## Target audience

## Maturity

## Distributions

* Community
* Enterprise

## Deployment models

* Managed Kubernetes: KCluster, ...
* Public cloud: EKS, AKS, GKE
* On premises: VMWare
* Hybrid

## Installation

## Configurability

## Network Management

## Maintenance

* Ops skills/expertise
* Support (community or tiered)
* Release frequency

## Security

* Updates
* TLS
* Auth
* Secrets
* Network policy

## On-demand provisioning

## Continuous delivery options

* How do we make the developer's life easier? And/or reduce responsibility by encapsulating and automating the process of container image builds -- cf push versus kubectl create

## Supported integrations

## Portability

* Hybrid, muli-cloud provider architectures through federation

## Scalability

* Footprint
* Deployment schemes
* Horizontal pod/node auto-scaling

## High Availability

* Infrastructure: nfs, block stores, specialized storage plugins
* Applications: replica sets, replication controllers, pet sets
* Components: etcd, api server, nodes
